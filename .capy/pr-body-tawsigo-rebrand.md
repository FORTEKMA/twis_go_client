Rebrand UI to TawsiGO: colors and app name updates

Summary
- Set primary brand color to #F37A1D and secondary color to #18365A
- Update app display name to "TawsiGO" on iOS (CFBundleDisplayName/FacebookDisplayName) and Android (app_name)
- Update user-facing strings referencing "Tawsilet" to "TawsiGO" where appropriate (no package IDs or service configs changed)
- Replace hardcoded brand blacks (#030303/#0c0c0c) used for buttons, borders, and accents with the new primary color
- Keep logic intact — changes are UI-only

Key changes
- src/utils/colors.js: primary => #F37A1D, secondary => #18365A
- android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml: app_name => TawsiGO
- ios/TwisGo/Info.plist: CFBundleDisplayName & FacebookDisplayName => TawsiGO; location permission strings mention TawsiGO
- src/local/locales/en.json & fr.json: "Update required" messages now say TawsiGO Driver
- UI components (Login, LoginModal, Register, Onboarding, OTP, MainScreen, Profile, Alerts, etc.): replaced brand color usages (#030303/#0c0c0c) for buttons, borders, progress bars with #F37A1D
- Drawer version label now shows "TawsiGO v{appVersion}"

Impact
- Visual refresh only; no functional logic changes
- Bundle IDs, Firebase/Sentry configs and domains remain unchanged

Notes
- Brand images (e.g., tawsiletYellow.png) were left as-is since updated assets were not provided. We can swap them for TawsiGO assets when available.
